## Overview

ACSO is a multi-agent system designed to provide proactive IT management and security through coordinated AI agents. It transforms IT operations from reactive "firefighting" to proactive, intelligent automation using Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

### Key Features

- **üõ°Ô∏è Proactive Threat Hunting**: Autonomous detection and analysis of security threats
- **‚ö° Incident Response**: Automated containment and response actions
- **üîß Service Orchestration**: Intelligent IT service management and automation
- **üí∞ Financial Intelligence**: Cost optimization and revenue analysis
- **ü§ñ Multi-Agent Coordination**: Specialized AI agents working together seamlessly

## Architecture

ACSO implements a supervisor-agent pattern with five specialized agents:

1. **Supervisor Agent** - Orchestrates workflows and coordinates other agents
2. **Threat Hunter Agent** - Proactive threat detection and analysis
3. **Incident Response Agent** - Automated incident containment and response
4. **Service Orchestration Agent** - IT service management and automation
5. **Financial Intelligence Agent** - Cost optimization and financial analysis

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- AWS Account with Bedrock access
- Docker (for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/acso.git
   cd acso
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure AWS credentials**
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

4. **Set up configuration**
   ```bash
   cp config/settings.py.example config/settings.py
   # Edit config/settings.py with your specific settings
   ```

5. **Deploy infrastructure**
   ```bash
   # Using AWS CDK
   cd infrastructure/cdk
   cdk deploy

   # Or using CloudFormation
   aws cloudformation create-stack \
     --stack-name acso-infrastructure \
     --template-body file://infrastructure/cloudformation/acso-infrastructure.yaml
   ```

6. **Run the system**
   ```bash
   python -m src.main
   ```

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t acso:latest .

# Run with docker-compose
docker-compose up -d
```

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Unit tests
pytest tests/

# Integration tests
python tests/integration/run_integration_tests.py

# Performance tests
python tests/performance/run_performance_tests.py
```

## Configuration

Key configuration options in `config/settings.py`:

```python
# AWS Configuration
AWS_REGION = "us-east-1"
BEDROCK_AGENT_CORE_ENDPOINT = "https://bedrock-agent-core.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"

# Agent Configuration
SUPERVISOR_AGENT_CONFIG = {
    "max_concurrent_workflows": 100,
    "decision_timeout_seconds": 30,
    "escalation_threshold": 0.7
}

# Security Configuration
ENCRYPTION_KEY_ID = "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
```

## API Usage

ACSO provides a comprehensive REST API for integration:

```python
import requests

# Get agent status
response = requests.get(
    "https://api.acso.your-domain.com/v1/agents/status",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
)

# Create incident
incident = requests.post(
    "https://api.acso.your-domain.com/v1/incidents",
    json={
        "title": "Security Alert",
        "severity": "high",
        "description": "Suspicious activity detected"
    },
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
)
```
