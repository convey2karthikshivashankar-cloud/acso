# ACSO System Architecture

## Overview

The Autonomous Cyber-Security & Service Orchestrator (ACSO) is a multi-agent system designed to provide proactive IT management and security through coordinated AI agents. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, design decisions, and technical implementation details.

## Architecture Principles

### Design Philosophy

1. **Agent-Based Architecture**: Modular design with specialized agents for different domains
2. **Autonomous Operation**: Minimal human intervention with intelligent decision-making
3. **Scalable Design**: Cloud-native architecture supporting horizontal scaling
4. **Security-First**: Built-in security controls and compliance features
5. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging throughout the system

### Key Design Decisions

#### Multi-Agent Coordination
- **Decision**: Implement a supervisor-agent pattern with specialized sub-agents
- **Rationale**: Provides clear separation of concerns while enabling coordinated responses
- **Trade-offs**: Increased complexity in exchange for modularity and maintainability

#### AWS-Native Implementation
- **Decision**: Build entirely on AWS services, particularly Amazon Bedrock AgentCore
- **Rationale**: Leverages managed AI services, reduces operational overhead, ensures scalability
- **Trade-offs**: Vendor lock-in in exchange for reduced infrastructure management

#### Event-Driven Communication
- **Decision**: Use asynchronous message passing between agents
- **Rationale**: Enables loose coupling, better fault tolerance, and scalability
- **Trade-offs**: Eventual consistency model requires careful state management
