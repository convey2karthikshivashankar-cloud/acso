## 🔧 **Issues Identified & Fixed**

### 1. **CSS/JS Path Resolution Issue**
**Problem**: CSS and JavaScript files were referenced with absolute paths (`/css/`, `/js/`) which don't work with S3 static hosting.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `vite.config.ts` to use `base: './'` for relative paths
- All assets now load correctly from S3

### 2. **Bootstrap vs Material-UI Conflict**
**Problem**: The app was using Bootstrap CSS classes but only had Material-UI installed, causing unstyled components.

**Solution**:
- Completely rewrote the main App component to use Material-UI components
- Replaced all Bootstrap classes with proper Material-UI components
- Added proper ThemeProvider and CssBaseline for consistent styling

### 3. **Component Structure & Alignment**
**Problem**: Poor text alignment, inconsistent spacing, and broken layout structure.

**Solution**:
- Implemented proper Material-UI Grid system for responsive layout
- Added consistent spacing using Material-UI's `sx` prop system
- Proper text alignment and typography hierarchy
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
